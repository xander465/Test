            <h2>1. Computer Programmer  </h2>
            <p> - Computer programmers write and test the code that allows computer applications and programs to 
function. They may translate the designs of software developers and engineers into workable code. They may also update or expand 
the code of existing programs. Or, they may test programs for errors, finding and resolving faulty lines of code.</p>

        <h2>2.Computer Hardware Engineers </h2> 
        <p>-Computer hardware engineers create the physical components that make computers run. They 
routinely design new hardware systems, test their designs, analyze the results of their tests, and manage the manufacturing of their 
completed projects. When new software changes users’ needs, these professionals redesign hardware to work with the new programs. 
These engineers design the physical parts inside computers. They may concentrate on creating routers, processors, networks, memory 
devices, or circuit boards.</p>

        <h2>3. Software Developers </h2>
        <p>-Software developers use various source debuggers and visual development environments to modify, write, 
and debug software for client applications. They also document and test client software and write code to create applications that 
either stand alone or boost access to servers and services. </p>

        <h2>4. Computer and Information Systems Managers  </h2>
        <p>- Computer and information systems managers generally oversee the information 
technology departments within a business or an organization. Much of a system manager's duties depend on the size of the 
organization, and how much technology they use on a daily basis. In a smaller setting, a systems manager.</p>

        <h2>5. Web Developers </h2> 
        <p>- Web development is a specialized type of computer programming focused on websites and web applications. 
Though often used interchangeably, web development and web design differ in key areas. Web design deals with the front-end of a 
site and concerns itself with appearance and user experience, while web development deals with building technical front-end and/or 
back-end code that informs site function. Web developers may work exclusively on front-end code, back-end code, or both, and many 
modern jobs also require overlap into web design. </p>

        <h2> 6. Computer software engineers</h2>
        <p>-apply engineering principles and systematic methods to develop programs 
and operating data for computers. If you have ever asked yourself, “What does a software engineer do?” note that daily tasks vary 
widely. Professionals confer with system programmers, analysts, and other engineers to extract pertinent information for designing 
systems, projecting capabilities, and determining performance interfaces. Computer software engineers also analyze user needs, 
provide consultation services to discuss design elements, and coordinate software installation. Designing software systems requires 
professionals to consider mathematical models and scientific analysis to project outcome
